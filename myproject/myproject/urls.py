Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path

# URL Chaining
# It is a way to isolate urls in a large project
# The main request always lands in root urls.py.
# But the request can be forwarded to individual apps
# This helps in proper structuring of huge projects
